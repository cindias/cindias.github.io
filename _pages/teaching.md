My teaching approach emphasizes creating inclusive, supportive learning environments where students can engage with quantitative methods and demographic concepts. Below are selected comments from student evaluations during my time as a teaching assistant at Princeton University:

_"This preceptor was wonderful. She was extremely helpful in teaching concepts that the lectures failed to teach, and helping to understand computationally as well. She was always readily available to help students, quick to respond, and always so kind."_

_"She made my experience in this course bearable and is the reason I decided not to drop this course."_

_"Zoey was a life saver. Amazing preceptor, she really took after herself to make sure we understood the material and advocated for us and was very supportive of outstanding circumstances."_

_"Zoey did a great job asking us thought-provoking questions and was diligent in getting students to engage."_

_"Zoey was a great preceptor. She tried really hard to make precept engaging and interesting for all students, tailoring her precept to the specific interests of the people in the class while still covering all the necessary topics."_

_"Zoey is a great preceptor. She always came well prepared and with many questions for us, and I really think she aided my learning a lot. Also, she was always willing to help in office hours too."_
