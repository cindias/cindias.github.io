Hello! I am a demographer studying the intersection of family, health, and aging. I completed my Ph.D. in Demography and Social Policy at Princeton University, Office of Population Research, and am currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University of Michigan, working on NIA-funded projects examining family availability and ADRD care trajectories.

My research explores how demographic changes—-declining fertility, shifting marriage patterns, and increasing geographic mobility—-reshape family support networks and healthy aging trajectories across diverse populations. Using demographic methods like Sullivan's healthy life expectancy and multistate life tables, I examine how demographic changes transform family arrangements at older ages, the implications for inequalities in well-being, with emphasis on cognitive impairments and social-emotional outcomes, and how to address measurement challenges in longitudinal aging surveys to accurately understand health inequality and project future care needs.

My work has appeared in *Demography*, *Journal of Gerontology: Social Sciences*, *Age and Ageing*, among others, and has been featured in *South China Morning Post*. I also write about demographic trends for public audiences, including [Scientific American](https://scientificamerican.com/article/chinas-population-could-shrink-to-half-by-2100/).
