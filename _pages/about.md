Hello! I am a demographer studying the intersection of family, health, and aging. I completed my Ph.D. in Demography and Social Policy from Princeton University, Office of Population Research, and am currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University of Michigan, working on NIA-funded projects examining family availability and ADRD care trajectories. I am also affiliated with the Population Studies Center and the Stone Center for Inequality Dynamics. 

My research explores how demographic shifts—declining fertility, changing marriage patterns, and increased geographic mobility—are reshaping family support networks and healthy aging across diverse populations. I use demographic methods like Sullivan's healthy life expectancy and multistate life tables to examine three key questions: How are demographic changes transforming family arrangements in later life? What do these changes mean for health inequalities, particularly regarding cognitive decline and social well-being? And how can we improve measurement approaches in aging studies to better understand health disparities and forecast future care needs?

My work has been or will be published in _Demography_, _Journal of Gerontology: Social Sciences_, _Age and Ageing_, and other journals, with coverage in the _South China Morning Post_. I also write about demographic trends for broader audiences, including [Scientific American](https://scientificamerican.com/article/chinas-population-could-shrink-to-half-by-2100/).
