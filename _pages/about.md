Hello! I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Office of Population Research, Princeton University. I study the intersection of family change and demographic processes. My research explores three related aspects: (1) how mortality and migration influence the formation and dissolution of families across the life course, (2) the social stratification of emotions in aging populations, and (3) how data quality affects our understanding of social inequality in the context of extended longevity. I also write about demographics in [China](https://scientificamerican.com/article/chinas-population-could-shrink-to-half-by-2100/).

I am also affiliated with the [School of Public and International Affairs](https://jdp.princeton.edu/people/xueqing-zoey-wang).
