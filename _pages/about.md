Hello! I am a PhD candidate at the Office of Population Research, Princeton University. I study the intersection of family change and demographic processes. Specifically, I am interested in how mortality and migration affect the formation and dissolution of families in the context of population aging. In my spare time, I write about demographics in [China](https://scientificamerican.com/article/chinas-population-could-shrink-to-half-by-2100/).
