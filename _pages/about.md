Hello! I am a PhD candidate at the Office of Population Research, Princeton University. I study the intersection of family change and demographic processes. Specifically, I am interested in how mortality and migration affect the formation and dissolution of families in the context of population aging. In my spare time I write about demographics in China [link](https://scientificamerican.com/article/chinas-population-could-shrink-to-half-by-2100/).

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
