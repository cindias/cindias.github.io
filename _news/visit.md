Recently, I had two visits: one at the Department of Sociology at the University of Wisconsin, Madison and another at the Department of Sociology at the University of Texas at Austin. 
I shared my ongoing work on internal migration and the demography of loneliness in China, and received thoughtful questions that are helping me revise the paper further. I’m grateful to everyone who hosted me and coordinated these visits.
