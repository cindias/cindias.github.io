  title={Beyond Lifelong Marriage and Spousal Coresidence: A Research Note on Racial and Ethnic Differences in Late-Life Family and Living Arrangements},
  author={Xueqing Wang*†, Xuezhixing Zhang, and Emma Zang},
  abstract={We use an innovative Bayesian Multi-State Life Table approach to examine how race, ethnicity, and sex shape marital status and living arrangements in later life. Using the Health and Retirement Study (1992–2018), we estimate expected years spent in various marital and living arrangements after age 50. Our findings reveal stark disparities: White adults largely follow traditional patterns, spending most of their later years married and living with a spouse. In contrast, Black adults experience the shortest durations of marriage and spousal co-residence, spending much of later life alone or with non-spouse family members. Hispanic adults occupy an intermediate position, maintaining substantial years in marriage while also spending extended time in multigenerational households. These patterns are further stratified by sex, with minority women experiencing significantly fewer years married and living with a spouse than men, amplifying their reliance on alternative family support structures. These findings underscore how the intersection of race, ethnicity, and sex shapes later-life social and economic security, emphasizing the need for policies that account for diverse family structures in aging populations.},
